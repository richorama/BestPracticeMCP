# Best Practices MCP - Centralized Coding Guidelines POC

## Overview

Best Practices MCP is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** that demonstrates how to provide centralized best practice guidelines to AI code generation tools like GitHub Copilot using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. 

This project showcases how development teams can maintain consistent coding standards across projects by creating a central repository of style guides and coding practices that AI assistants can reference during code generation.

## The Problem

When using AI code generation tools across multiple projects or team members, maintaining consistent coding standards becomes challenging because:

- Each developer may have different coding preferences
- AI tools lack context about team-specific conventions
- Style guides are often documented separately and not integrated into the development workflow
- Code reviews become focused on style rather than logic and architecture

## The Solution

Best Practices MCP demonstrates how to solve this by:

1. **Centralizing Guidelines**: Creating a single source of truth for coding standards
2. **MCP Integration**: Using the Model Context Protocol to make guidelines accessible to AI tools
3. **Real-time Access**: Enabling AI assistants to query best practices during code generation
4. **Team Consistency**: Ensuring all team members and AI tools follow the same conventions

## How It Works

```mermaid

    A[Developer + AI Tool] --> B[MCP Client]
    B --> C[Best Practices MCP Server]
    C --> D[Style Guide Repository]
    D --> C
    C --> B
    B --> A
```

1. **Developer** requests code generation from an AI tool (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
2. **AI Tool** queries the MCP server for relevant coding guidelines
3. **MCP Server** retrieves appropriate best practices from the central repository
4. **Guidelines** are provided as context to inform code generation
5. **Generated Code** follows team standards automatically

## Key Benefits

- **🎯 Consistency**: All generated code follows the same standards
- **⚡ Real-time**: Guidelines are applied during generation, not after
- **🔄 Centralized**: One place to update standards for all projects
- **🤖 AI-Friendly**: Works seamlessly with existing AI development tools
- **📈 Scalable**: Easy to add new guidelines and extend to new projects

## Example Use Cases

### Language-Specific Guidelines
```typescript
// AI queries for TypeScript best practices
// Receives: "Use strict typing, prefer interfaces over types for object shapes"
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

### Framework Conventions
```python
# AI queries for Python/FastAPI guidelines  
# Receives: "Use dependency injection, type hints, and async/await"
async def get_user(user_id: str, db: Database = Depends(get_db)) -> UserResponse:
    return await db.fetch_user(user_id)
```

### Architecture Patterns
```javascript
// AI queries for React component guidelines
// Receives: "Use functional components, custom hooks for logic"
const useUserData = (userId) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  // ... hook logic
  return user;
};
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MCP-compatible AI development environment

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/BestPracticesMCP.git
cd BestPracticesMCP
npm install
```

### Setup
```bash
# Start the MCP server
npm run start

# Configure your AI tool to use the MCP server
# (Configuration details vary by tool)
```

## Configuration

Add to your AI tool's MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "best-practices-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./server/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GUIDELINES_PATH": "./guidelines"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Contributing Guidelines
